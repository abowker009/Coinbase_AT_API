# Coinbase_AT_API
Templates to help you with Advance Trade Websocket level 2 data. 

Note currently I have it set up to only return the top 2 bids and offers from the orderbook. Please make the necessary changes. 
Also you will need to change the code a tad if you want this to run constantly as you will recieves errors every once in a while from Coinbase.
